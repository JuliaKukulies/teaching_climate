    "in, and they are scattered across the ocean. Definitely not at nicely gridded locations. But we’re going\n",
    "to bring them onto a regular grid. There are many reasons why one would want to do that, but most commonly in climate science:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- because you want to compare two products (e.g. models and observations) that are given on\n",
    "different grids\n",
